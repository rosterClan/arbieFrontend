## About The Project
A few years ago, I discovered arbitrage betting—a method where you place bets on all possible outcomes of an event to guarantee a profit. For instance, in a basketball game offering fixed odds of 50-to-1 for both teams, wagering one dollar on each team ensures a profit of $48. Motivated by this, I developed a system to aggregate real-time horse racing data from multiple bookmakers in order to identify arbitrage opportunities. This involved reverse engineering each bookmaker’s front-end to emulate their real-time data delivery, as well as recreating the processes for generating authentication tokens and constructing API calls needed to access horse racing data from events across Australia. As a result, I now have near-instant access to the odds for every entrant in every race at each meeting, enabling me to run simulations and refine a profitable betting strategy.
