</div>

## About The Project
A frontend companion to the backend multi-bookmaker horse racing odds aggregator. A public facing API was created with Golang, which interacts with an SQL database populated by the asformented odds aggregator backend. Data is then presented on a React frontend, allowing for navigation and display of odds offerings for entrants across various races/meets.
