</div>

## About The Project
A frontend companion to the backend multi-bookmaker horse racing odds aggregator. A public facing API was created with Golang, which interacts with an SQL database populated by the asformented odds aggregator backend. Data is then presented on a React frontend, allowing for navigation and display of odds offerings for entrants across various races/meets. A major aspect of this project was deisgning a usable frontend, allowing me to interest with my betting system using a useable web-interface. A major aspect of this project are the wireframes and figma designs I created, aiding me in the web-interfaces development. This project is currently incomplete. But I'm hoping to eventually support the following features: 

### Desired Features
1. Use a date selecter to view past and current horse races occuring throughout Australia 
    * Data aquired via the horse race arbitrage scraper project linked here
2. Allow the user to select a specific race, viewing all the entrents for said race and all the current odds being offered on said entrant by Australian bookies.
3. Allow the user to create virtual bets, such that they can engage in the betting markets without the risk of real financial loss.
